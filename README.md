# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

I created this JavaScript quiz to serve as a study tool for people that want to learn about JavaScript. I was motivated to do this as practice for myself with the language. It fills the void of a lack of free and accessible JavaScript quizzes available for use on the internet. I learned the importance of event listeners, how to use local storage, and about the usefulness of interval timers.
